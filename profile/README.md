# Build With LCOD

**LCOD (Lowâ€‘Code On Demand)** is a compose-first platform: applications are assembled from reusable components instead of glue code. Every block ships with schemas, docs, and tests; a lightweight kernel runs those blocks across runtimes; a Git-native registry and resolver keep delivery reproducible.

## Pillars

- **Specification first** â€“ `lcod-spec` defines `lcp.toml`, the `compose` DSL, shared fixtures, and helper components.
- **Portable kernels** â€“ `lcod-kernel-js` (Node) and `lcod-kernel-rs` (Rust) share identical execution semantics.
- **Git-native distribution** â€“ `lcod-registry` publishes manifests and the generated catalogue (`packages.jsonl`, `registry.json`) so clients can resolve, verify, and cache components.
- **Composable tooling** â€“ `lcod-resolver` expresses the resolution pipeline in LCOD; CI/CLI scripts reuse the same helpers.
- **Design-time assistance** â€“ the upcoming IDE + RAG stack helps humans (and agents) search, assemble, and validate flows before shipping.

## Whatâ€™s Next

- Harden the registry: hash/signature validation, GitHub Pages mirror, `.lcpkg` artefacts.
- Enrich the helper catalogue (core contracts, adapters) and publish compatibility matrices.
- Ship the LCOD IDE preview (RAG integration + live compose editing).
- Expand the assemble â†’ ship â†’ build pipeline across languages.
